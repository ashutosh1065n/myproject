First, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your project is located. If you haven't already created a virtual environment, you can create one using the command **python3 -m venv venv**. This will create a folder named venv (or any name you prefer) in your project directory. To activate the virtual environment, use source **venv/bin/activate** as the command. Once activated, you should see the virtual environment's name in parentheses in your terminal prompt, like this: **(venv) your-username@your-mac project-folder %**.

To execute the script in the project directory, under the root folder of the project and run the command **python app/model.py** in the terminal. This command will generate and save 9 .pkl (Pickle) files in the _models/_ directory, which are serialized objects containing model data, ready for later use in deployment.

Run the app.py file in VS Code terminal using **python app/app.py** , it shows flask app running in debug mode on the local server at **http://127.0.0.1:5000**, and the development server is actively monitoring file changes. Browsering the URL will load the project interface, allowing you to interact with the application and test its functionality.

Make sure you have the _project_ database set up in your MySQL instance. This database is crucial for storing the prediction details generated by the application. You should ensure that the database exists and is accessible to the application for proper functionality. You can verify the database setup by checking your MySQL server or using a database management tool.
